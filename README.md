## Main Features

### Current version

The current **1.4.2** version has been focused on two main features :

<br/>

* **Store Locator :**

    This feature allows you to **create and manage your shops** in Magento's back-office. The module comes by default with several pre-configured attributes such as Shop Address, GPS coordinates, Opening Hours, etc...

    Once you have created all your shops, your customers will be able to navigate through them in the Front-Office on a **map**.

![Stores Map](doc/static/shop-map.png)

Each of your stores has also a **Shop detail page** and eventually a **Contact Shop page** if you enable this option on the store.

Your customer will be able to choose his favorite shop and this will keep it during all his navigation through your website.

<br/>

* **Store Offers :**

    This features let you create **specific offers for a given product and a given shop** : you'll be able to define the price and/or the availability for a product in each shop.
